%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function deletes information about dead and slow cells
%
% INPUTS:
%       
%       OUTdata is data to be processed
%
%       MinVel is the minimum velocity value for analysis
%
%       VelData is velocity data
%
%       Vel is average velocity for tracks
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%       Vel is the array of velocity of each track
%
%       VelData is the velocity data for all tracks over time
%
%       dataCLEAN is clean data after deleting dead cell 
%
% USE: 
%       
%  [VelData,Vel,dataCLEAN] = DeleteSlowCells(Vel,VelData,MinVel,dataCLEAN);
